# onAirVR Server for Unity ![current release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/onairvr/onairvr-server-for-unity.svg)

Make your PC VR game wirelessly playable!

onAirVR makes a mobile VR device act as a wireless VR HMD for a desktop by streaming video/audio which are rendered in realtime on the desktop to onAirVR mobile apps. This is the plugin for developing onAirVR contents on Unity game engine.



## Before Getting Started

onAirVR consists of two applications - mobile VR client app & contents app on PC. This plugin is for PC contents, and here are plugins for mobile VR platforms we supports :

- [onAirVR Client for Oculus Mobile](https://github.com/onairvr/onairvr-client-for-oculus-mobile)
- [onAirVR Client for Google VR](https://github.com/onairvr/onairvr-client-for-googlevr)




## Downloads

You can download the pre-exported package for each version from [Releases](https://github.com/onairvr/onairvr-server-for-unity/releases).

You may clone this whole project. It is worth noting that the project itself is maintained on Unity 5.6.5f1 which is the lowest compatible version, but it is safely migrated to higher versions of Unity.
